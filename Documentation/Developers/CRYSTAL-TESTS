                  Standard Prerelease Tests for Crystal ROCK
                  ==========================================

This is a proposed test procedure for the Crystal ROCK distribution. It must be
passed for before a release may be done. Any additional test are fine too, but
not part of a standard procedure.


1. Install Tests
================

Various install scenarios should be tested. 1.a and 1.b can be done in qemu.

1.a The simple install
----------------------

A full install with one big 2GB (or greater) root disk and a 500 MB swap
partition. Installation is done using the "next, next, next" approach. The only
dialogs where a different behavior than simply pressing enter are for setting
the root password and doing the partitioning.

The system should boot up with a fully-functional X server and kde.

Konqueror, kontact, konsole, gimp and mozilla should start up fine and pass a
simply functionality test. Gimp should be able to access all the fonts
installed without any additional hacking. The KDE menus should list all the
programs installed.

1.b The heavy partitioning test
-------------------------------

A "base" install with the following partitioning scheme should go fine,
boot, allow logins, and shut down cleanly:

	part1	/       XFS         500 MB
	part2	/usr    ReiserFS  1.500 MB
	part3	<extended>        2.000 MB
	part5	/home   JFS         500 MB
	part6	/var    ext3        500 MB
	part7	/boot   ext2        500 MB
	part8	----    swap        500 MB

1.c The hardware autodetection test
-----------------------------------

A setup such as 1.a on a machine with SCSI disk and CD-ROM and a common
3d-accelerated graphics card with Linux/x.org support.

The SCSI devices should be autodetected without any troubles and x11 should be
auto-configured with full support for the graphics card.


2. The heavy testcase run
=========================

Every package can ship it's own testcase. There will be a simple way to run
them all. This should be done on a system with a full installation.


3. The end-user test
====================

A end user should install the system and give feedback.
