Introduction
------------

This configuration offers a cross-build of (a subset of) the build-bootstrap
package selection for the arm architecture as emulated by qemu-system-arm.
It includes support for all the hardware emulated by qemu, a working udev,
kernel and userland support for TCP/IP networking, and more.

With qemu and the resulting build you can at least:
- boot the kernel and first stage initrd,
- execute a shell from the initrd,
- load the second stage from a CD-ROM,
- and install packages from the CD on a hard disk.

The packages included should be sufficient for native builds on the targeted
platform.

Quick Start
-----------

Direct booting with framebuffer console:
qemu-system-arm -kernel build/bbs-arm-qemu-TRUNK-arm-EL-arm926ejs-cross-generic-expert/boot/zImage \
	-initrd build/bbs-arm-qemu-TRUNK-arm-EL-arm926ejs-cross-generic-expert/ROCK/target/initrd.img \
	-append "root=/dev/ram0 rw" -M versatilepb \
	-cdrom bbs-arm-qemu_cd1.iso -hda /srv/qemu.hda

Direct booting with serial console:
qemu-system-arm -kernel build/bbs-arm-qemu-TRUNK-arm-EL-arm926ejs-cross-generic-expert/boot/zImage \
	-initrd build/bbs-arm-qemu-TRUNK-arm-EL-arm926ejs-cross-generic-expert/ROCK/target/initrd.img \
	-append "root=/dev/ram0 console=ttyAMA0 rw" -nographic -M versatilepb \
	-cdrom bbs-arm-qemu_cd1.iso -hda /srv/qemu.hda

Hints And Known Bugs
--------------------

- The kernel and initrd image can also be found in the boot/ directory of the
  CD-ROM image.

- To use the CD-ROM image in qemu, create it after the build has finished:
	./scripts/Create-ISO bbs-arm-qemu bbs-arm-qemu

- To use a hard disk in qemu, create it with e.g.:
	qemu-img create /srv/qemu.hda 2048M

- When using a console on the serial port, be sure to enter 'ttyAMA0' as the
  terminal device in boot stage 2, or you won't get to see the command line.

- This build also works with '-M versatileab', for other machine types you only
  have to rebuild the kernel.

- For an unknown reason, find is broken in this build (but works in e.g. sparc
  and x86_64 cross-builds). Use oldfind instead.
