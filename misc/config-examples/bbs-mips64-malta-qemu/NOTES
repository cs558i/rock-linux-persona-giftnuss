Introduction
------------

This configuration offers a cross-build of (a subset of) the build-bootstrap
package selection for the mips64 architecture (Malta machines with a 20Kc CPU)
as emulated by qemu-system-mips64.
It includes support for all the hardware emulated by qemu, a working udev,
kernel and userland support for TCP/IP networking, and more.

With qemu and the resulting build you can at least:
- boot the kernel and first stage initrd,
- execute a shell from the initrd,
- mount NFS file systems,
- load the second stage from a CD-ROM or a HTTP server,
- and install packages from the CD on a hard disc.

The packages included should be sufficient for native builds on the targeted
platform.

Quick Start
-----------

- Direct boot with serial console:
   qemu-system-mips64 -cdrom bbs-mips-malta-qemu_cd1.iso -hda /srv/qemu.hda \
	-kernel build/bbs-mips64-malta-qemu-TRUNK-mips-64-EB-mips64-cross-generic-expert/boot/vmlinux \
	-initrd build/bbs-mips64-malta-qemu-TRUNK-mips-64-EB-mips64-cross-generic-expert/ROCK/target-finish/initrd.img \
	-append "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/ram0" -nographic -M malta

Hints And Known Bugs
--------------------

- To use the CD image in qemu, create it after the build has finished:
    ./scripts/Create-ISO bbs-mips64-malta-qemu bbs-mips64-malta-qemu

- To use a hard disk in qemu, create it with e.g.:
    qemu-img create /srv/qemu.hda 2048M

- The kernel and initrd image can also be found in the boot/ directory of the
  CD-ROM image.

- When using a console on the serial port, be sure to enter 'ttyS0' as the
  terminal device in boot stage 2, or you won't get to see the command line.
  Enter 'tts/0' to also set the baud rate of the serial port.

- To access HTTP or NFS servers in qemu, add the following options:
    -net nic -net tap

   You need root privileges for this, or have your system administrator set it
   up for you. When qemu starts it will create a network interface (tap0) on the
   host system and add an IP address/netmask (172.20.0.1/16) to it:

   host:/# ip addr show dev tap0
	19: tap0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN qlen 500
	    link/ether 00:ff:e1:75:9a:a0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
	    inet 172.20.0.1/16 brd 172.20.255.255 scope global tap0
	    inet6 fe80::2ff:e1ff:fe75:9aa0/64 scope link
	       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

   In the first boot stage of the emulated system, execute a shell, set up the
   network link and add an IP address on the same network:

   sh-3.2# ip link set up dev eth0
	[   41.026595] eth0: link up
   sh-3.2# ip addr add 172.20.0.20/16 dev eth0

   You should now be able to reach the host system:

   sh-3.2# ping -c3 172.20.0.1
	PING 172.20.0.1 (172.20.0.1): 56 octets data
	64 octets from 172.20.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=16.7 ms
