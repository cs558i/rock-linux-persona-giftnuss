	# This option allows the user to interrupt a filesystem check
	# on startup using ^C for when you positively, absolutely need
	# the machine NOW (when you need a laptop for a demonstration).
	# Default if unset: false
	allow_cancellation = true
	# This boolean relation controls whether or not the interval between
	# filesystem checks (either based on time or number of  mounts) should
	# be doubled if the system is running on battery.
	# Default if unset: true
	defer_check_on_battery = true
