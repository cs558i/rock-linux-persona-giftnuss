[I] multiple-precision floating-point computations with exact rounding library

[T] The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
[T] computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding). It is
[T] based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
[T]
[T] The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
[T] floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined
[T] semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for
[T] double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).
