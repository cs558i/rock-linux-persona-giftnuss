[I] A mathematical research tool for studying Bers slices of punctured tori.

[T] Bear is a tool for calculating and testing discreteness of holonomy
[T] representations of complex projective structures on punctured tori.
[T] It can be used to draw pictures of Bers slices and explore the
[T] geometry of quasifuchsian space in the SL_2(C) representation
[T] variety. It also has powerful scripting features that make it easy
[T] to create complex animations or to automate larger calculations.
