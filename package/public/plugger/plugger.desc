[I] Streaming Multimedia Plugin for Unix Mozilla

[T] Tired of getting teased by Windows users because your Mozilla isn't as
[T] |<()()|_ as theirs? Well, your problems are almost solved. Plugger is a
[T] multimedia plugin for Unix Mozilla, Opera or Netscape that handles Quicktime,
[T] MPEG, MP2, AVI, SGI-movie, Tiff, DL, IFF-anim, MIDI, Soundtracker, AU, WAV
[T] and Commodore 64 audio files. And now, with Plugger 5.1.3, MPEG audio and
[T] video can be played streaming. No more waiting! Plugger is a very small
[T] plugin, because Plugger uses external programs to show/play the different
[T] formats.
