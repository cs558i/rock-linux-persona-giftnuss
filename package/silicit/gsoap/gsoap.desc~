[I] Toolkit for SOAP Web Services and XML-Based Applications

[T] A cross-platform open source C and C++ software development toolkit.
[T] Generates C/C++ RPC code, XML data bindings, and efficient 
[T] schema-specific parsers for SOAP Web services and other applications 
[T] that benefit from an XML interface.
[T] The gSOAP toolkit implements the XML data binding through the use of
[T] compiler technologies. These technologies map XML schemas to C/C++
[T] definitions and vice versa. There are two main advantages to this 
[T] approach. Firstly, strong typing is effectively leveraged to ensure 
[T] data content validation of SOAP messages and XML documents. 
[T] Secondly, compiler-based schema-specific parsing is more efficient 
[T] than most other XML parsing techniques.
[T]
[T] The gSOAP toolkit also generates WSDL and XML schemas (XSD) for 
[T] existing C/C++ data types and application functions, thereby 
[T] supporting and simplifying the conversion of legacy code into Web 
[T] services. Code portability has been achieved for many platforms, 
[T] including embedded systems
[T] and real-time software.
