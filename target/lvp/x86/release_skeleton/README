Using binary release of LVP

Using the binary release of LVP is a rather simple process:

WARNING: You must be root to complete this process if you want to use
WARNING: encryption!

Just start ./config.sh, make your settings, use options
c and i to create the iso and then burn this iso (named lvp.iso)
using your favorite cd/dvd writing software.


This binary was compiled COMPILEDFOR.

Have a lot of fun,
